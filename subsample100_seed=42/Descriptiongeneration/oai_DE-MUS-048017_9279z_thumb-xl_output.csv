Assistant: The image depicts a pencil drawing of three arches supported by columns. The arches are semi-circular in shape, and the columns are fluted with decorative capitals. The arches are arranged in a row, with the leftmost arch slightly smaller than the middle arch and the rightmost arch slightly larger than the middle arch. The columns are evenly spaced, with the leftmost column being slightly closer to the left edge of the drawing and the rightmost column being slightly closer to the right edge. The arches are supported by the columns, which are connected to the arches by a series of horizontal beams. The drawing is done in a classical style, with a focus on the architectural details of the arches and columns. The drawing is signed by the artist, ""Huygheken B.P. 13 Doy""."
