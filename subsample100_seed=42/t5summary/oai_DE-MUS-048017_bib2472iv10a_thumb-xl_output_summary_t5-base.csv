Description,Formatted Summary
"User:<image>Describe the image with details and give key words to describe the motifs. Assistant: The image depicts a sketch of a person's face, likely a male, drawn in a minimalist style. The drawing is primarily composed of black lines, with some shading to suggest depth and form. The person's head is tilted slightly to the right, and their face is depicted in profile. The person is wearing a cap, which is drawn in a simple, almost abstract manner. The cap is positioned on the person's head, covering their ears and part of their forehead. The person's hair is not clearly visible, as it is mostly obscured by the cap.  The background of the image is a solid, light brown color, which contrasts with the black lines of the drawing. The background is not textured, suggesting it might be a flat surface, possibly a piece of paper or a canvas. There are no other objects or elements in the image, making the focus entirely on the drawing of the person's face.","Summary: the image depicts a sketch of a person's face, likely a male, drawn in a minimalist style ."
