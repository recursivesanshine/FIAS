Input 1:
User:<image>Describe the image with details and give key words to describe the motifs.
Assistant: The image consists of three sheets of paper, each containing a different drawing. The first sheet features a detailed drawing of a column, likely representing a column of a building or a column from a structure. The column is depicted with intricate details, including the base, shaft, and capital. The second sheet contains a drawing of an architectural element, possibly a capital or a decorative element, with a similar level of detail. The third sheet features a sketch of a building or a structure, with a focus on the roof and the surrounding environment.

The drawings are done in a minimalist style, with simple lines and minimal shading. The overall composition of the drawings is clean and uncluttered, allowing for easy identification of the subject matter. The drawings are not overly detailed, focusing on capturing the essential features of the subject.

The text on the first sheet reads "Dr. Prof. Dr. med. Dr. phil. Dr. med. Dr. med. Dr. med. Dr. med. Dr. med. Dr. med. Dr. med. Dr. med. Dr. med. Dr. med. Dr. med. Dr. med. Dr. med. Dr. med. Dr. med.
