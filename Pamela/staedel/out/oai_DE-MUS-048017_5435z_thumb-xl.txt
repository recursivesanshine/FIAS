The image is a circular drawing on aged paper, featuring a portrait with a soft, monochromatic palette. The subject is depicted wearing a flat cap and a ruffled collar, indicative of 16th-century European fashion. The inscription "C.K." and "is 40." suggest the initials and age of the individual, while "xl: 26.2x." likely refers to the drawing's scale. The artwork's style is reminiscent of a preparatory sketch, with visible pencil strokes and shading.
