The image is a monochromatic sketch of a male figure, likely from the Renaissance or Baroque period, characterized by its detailed musculature and dynamic pose. The figure is depicted in a three-quarter view, with the head turned slightly to the side, suggesting a contemplative or introspective mood. The sketch is executed in pencil on aged paper, with visible signs of wear and discoloration. The figure's attire is minimal, with a suggestion of a garment around the waist, and the arm is positioned as if holding an object, though it is not clearly defined.
