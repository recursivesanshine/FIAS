The image is a detailed sepia-toned engraving depicting a historical European street scene. On the left, a prominent brick tower with a dome and a flagpole stands tall, accompanied by a chimney. Adjacent buildings feature gabled roofs and ornate facades, with several windows and decorative elements. The street is bustling with figures in period attire, including women in long dresses and men in coats, some on horseback. The scene is set under a partly cloudy sky, with trees and a brick wall on the left.
