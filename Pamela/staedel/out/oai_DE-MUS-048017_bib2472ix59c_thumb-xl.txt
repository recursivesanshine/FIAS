The image is a pencil sketch featuring two female figures, likely from the late medieval or early Renaissance period, as indicated by the style of their clothing and the Italian text. The figure on the left is depicted in a long, flowing robe with a hood, holding a small object in her right hand. The figure on the right is similarly dressed, holding a stem with leaves and flowers in her left hand. The sketch is detailed, with annotations and measurements, suggesting it is a study for a larger work. The figures are drawn in profile, with attention to the folds of the garments and the positioning of the hands.
