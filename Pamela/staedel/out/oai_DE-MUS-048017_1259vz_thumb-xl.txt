The image is a sepia-toned sketch on aged paper, featuring the back of a figure in a dynamic pose, with one leg bent and the other extended, suggesting movement. The figure's clothing is depicted with loose, flowing lines, indicating voluminous trousers. The sketch is minimalistic, with no background details, focusing solely on the figure. In the lower left corner, there is a monogram "S" with the number "1259," likely indicating the artist's signature and a catalog number.
