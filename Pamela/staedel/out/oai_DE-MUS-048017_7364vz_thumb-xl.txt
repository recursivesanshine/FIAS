The image is a monochromatic sketch of a Gothic-style building, likely a church, characterized by pointed arches and vertical lines. The central feature is a large pointed arch window with a tracery design, suggesting a rose window. Flanking the window are two slender, pointed spires, and the roof is depicted with a simple gable. The sketch is executed in pencil on aged paper, showing signs of wear and a monogram "S&S" in the lower left corner.
