The image is a monochromatic pencil sketch of a male figure, likely from the 19th century, given the style of the clothing and the signature "J. Gyllenhaal." The sketch is executed in fine lines, capturing the contours of the face, hair, and attire, including a high-collared coat and a cravat. The paper shows signs of aging, with a slightly yellowed tone and some creases. The signature and a circular stamp are present in the lower right corner.
