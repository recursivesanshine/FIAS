The image features an abstract artwork on a cream-colored paper, dated "1930-31." It showcases a collage of geometric shapes in vibrant colors like green, red, purple, and blue, forming a stylized figure resembling a bird in flight. The figure is outlined with a thin black line, and the background is minimal, with a small blue area suggesting the ground. Below the artwork, there is handwritten text in German, which translates to "I became a swallow, I flew around the world, I became a bird again here." The signature "j.g." is present in the bottom right corner.
