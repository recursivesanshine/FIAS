The image is a monochromatic sketch of a knight in armor seated with a sword resting on his knee. The knight is wearing a helmet with a visor and a flowing cloak that drapes over the armor. The armor is detailed, with visible plates and joints, and the knight's left leg is bent, with the foot resting on the ground. The sword is long and straight, with a pointed tip. The sketch is executed in pencil on textured paper, with shading that highlights the armor's contours and the cloak's folds.
