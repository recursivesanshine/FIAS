The image depicts a watercolor painting of an arched doorway leading to a dimly lit interior. The arch is part of a stone structure, with visible signs of wear and age, such as chipped and missing stones. The painting uses a muted palette of browns, beiges, and soft whites, with light filtering through the arch, casting a gentle shadow on the ground. The scene is marked by the date "20 June 1861" in the lower right corner, suggesting a historical or architectural theme.
