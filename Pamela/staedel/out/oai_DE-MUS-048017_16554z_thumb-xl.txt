The image is a sepia-toned pencil sketch of a young boy standing upright, holding a book or tablet above his head with both hands. He is dressed in a long-sleeved shirt and knee-length pants, with his head bowed slightly, suggesting concentration or contemplation. The sketch is detailed, with visible pencil strokes and shading that provide depth and texture to the figure. The background is plain, with faint lines indicating a grid, and a partial outline of an animal, possibly a dog, is visible to the right.
