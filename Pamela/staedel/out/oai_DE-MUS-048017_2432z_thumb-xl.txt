The image depicts a side view of a cow in a sepia-toned sketch. The cow stands calmly on a grassy field, with its body facing left and head turned slightly to the right. Its fur is textured with short, wavy lines, and the udder is visible beneath its belly. The cow's horns are small and curved, and its tail is slightly raised. The background is minimal, with simple lines suggesting grass and a plain sky.
