The image is a sepia-toned sketch depicting a market scene, likely from the late 19th century, as indicated by the signature "S. 1881." It shows two men engaged in a transaction involving fish. The man on the right is handling a basket of fish, while the man on the left holds a small object, possibly a coin. A hanging carcass is visible in the background, suggesting a butcher shop or fish market setting. A third figure, possibly a child, is partially visible in the background. The sketch uses textured strokes to convey the atmosphere, with a focus on the interaction between the figures and the market environment.
