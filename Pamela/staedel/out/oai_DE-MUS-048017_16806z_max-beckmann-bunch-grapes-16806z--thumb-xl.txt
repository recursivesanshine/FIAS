The image is a detailed black and white sketch depicting a donkey-drawn cart loaded with clusters of grapes.

Two figures are seated on the cart, one holding a whip, indicating they are likely involved in transporting the grapes. The sketch is expressive, with dynamic lines and shading that convey movement and texture.
