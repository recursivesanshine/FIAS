The image is a monochromatic sketch of a church structure, featuring a prominent pointed spire with a cross at the top. The church includes a large arched gateway with a barred door, and the tower has a clock face and a small arched window. The sketch is executed in pencil on textured paper, with the date "Sechcim 3. Aug. 1828" inscribed at the bottom right. The drawing is detailed, with shading that suggests a three-dimensional form, and a sparse tree is visible to the left.
