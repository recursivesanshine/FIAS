The image is a monochromatic pencil sketch depicting two figures in a dimly lit setting. The woman, standing and gazing upward, is partially draped with a cloth that reveals her upper body. Her expression is contemplative, and her hair is long and flowing. The man, seated and leaning against a stone wall, appears to be in a state of distress or exhaustion, with his head bowed and hair disheveled. The sketch uses soft shading to create a sense of depth and intimacy, with the figures' interaction suggesting a narrative of emotional complexity.
