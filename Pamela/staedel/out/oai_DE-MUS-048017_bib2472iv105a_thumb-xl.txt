Two figures on the left are monks with halos, suggesting their saintly nature. The monk on the left gestures with his right hand, while the other holds a book, indicating a teaching or narrative moment. A young boy with a halo stands in front of them, holding a book, possibly a student or disciple. To the right, a woman with a halo appears to be in conversation with the boy. The setting is outdoors, with trees and foliage in the background, and the sketch is detailed with flowing robes and expressive gestures.
