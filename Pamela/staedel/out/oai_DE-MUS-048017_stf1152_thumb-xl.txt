The image depicts an interior courtyard of the Palazzo del Bargello in Florence, Italy, showcasing Gothic architectural elements. The space is characterized by tall, rounded arches supported by robust columns, with a stone-paved floor. A central fountain is visible, surrounded by a circular platform. The walls are constructed of rough-hewn stone, featuring small windows and niches. A staircase on the right leads to an upper level, and a statue is placed on the left side. The sepia tone of the photograph enhances the historical ambiance.
