The image features two sketches on a beige paper page. The top sketch depicts the ruins of a stone structure with an arched doorway, likely a historical site, dated "Tallandina, 23rd May 1877." The bottom sketch shows a distant view of a hill with a small structure, possibly a tower, set against a hazy landscape. The sketches are executed in pencil, using hatching and cross-hatching techniques to create texture and depth.
