The image is a sepia-toned sketch on aged paper, featuring two figures with religious connotations. On the left, a male figure with a halo suggests a saintly or holy character, depicted in profile with a solemn expression. On the right, a female figure, likely a nun, is shown in three-quarter view with her hands clasped in prayer, wearing a head covering. The sketch is detailed with line work that highlights the folds of the garments and the serene expressions of the figures.
