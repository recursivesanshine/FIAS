The painting depicts a serene pastoral scene set in a lush forest. The foreground features a variety of trees with dense foliage, including a prominent tree with a large trunk and a distinctive split. A small stream meanders through the scene, reflecting the surrounding greenery. Several cows, both white and brown, graze peacefully near the water's edge. Two figures, likely shepherds, are present, one near the stream and another further back, adding a sense of scale and activity. The sky is partly cloudy, suggesting a tranquil day.
