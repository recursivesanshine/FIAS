The image is a long, narrow classical frieze featuring a series of figures in dynamic poses, set against a green background with a yellow border. On the left, a group of figures is engaged in a tender scene, with some embracing and others interacting with children. Moving right, a figure runs energetically, followed by another leaping and reaching for a ball. The scene concludes with figures in various states of motion, including one lying on the ground. The artwork is rendered in monochromatic tones, with the figures in white and the background in green, suggesting a classical or neoclassical style.
