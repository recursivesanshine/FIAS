The painting depicts two figures in an intimate setting. A woman stands with her back to the viewer, holding a white cloth over her head, wearing a teal garment that drapes around her waist. She is embraced by a seated man, who is shirtless and wrapped in a yellow cloth. The scene is set in a room with soft lighting, suggested by a window on the right. The brushwork is loose and expressive, with a muted color palette of blues, greens, and skin tones.
