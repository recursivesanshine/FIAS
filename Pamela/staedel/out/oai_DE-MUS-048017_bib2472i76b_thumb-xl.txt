The image is a monochromatic sketch depicting a landscape view from St. Gradisa, looking towards Fulgine and Greui. It features a series of rolling hills and mountains in the background, with a valley in the foreground containing clusters of trees and small structures, possibly buildings or houses. The sketch is executed in pencil, with varying line weights to create depth and texture. The paper shows signs of age, with a slightly yellowed tone and a rough edge, indicating it might be a historical document.
