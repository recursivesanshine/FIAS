The image is a detailed watercolor sketch by A. Bjugin, dated 1893, depicting a serene riverside scene. A solitary figure stands by a wooden structure near the water's edge, with a boat resting nearby. The landscape features sparse vegetation and a distant horizon, under a soft, overcast sky. The muted color palette of browns, grays, and blues enhances the tranquil and contemplative atmosphere.
