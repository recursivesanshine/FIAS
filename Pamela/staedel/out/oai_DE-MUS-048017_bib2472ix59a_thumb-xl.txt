The image is a monochromatic sketch depicting a religious scene, likely a preparatory drawing for a fresco or altarpiece. At the center, the Virgin Mary is shown holding the infant Jesus, with both figures adorned in flowing robes. Flanking them are two angels, one on each side, each with wings and halos, contributing to the sacred atmosphere. The left angel appears to be playing a musical instrument, while the right angel holds a book, symbolizing divine music and knowledge. The inscription at the bottom reads "SANCTA MARIA SVCCESSERIS INWA PVSSILLATIS REFOE FLEBLES ORA PRO PO PVLO EVNCTO TREBANO," which may reference a prayer or dedication. The sketch is detailed, with careful attention to the drapery and expressions, conveying a serene and reverent mood.
