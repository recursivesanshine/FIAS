The image is a sketch of a cat resting on a piece of furniture, likely a table or bench. The cat is depicted in a relaxed pose, with its body stretched out and head turned slightly to the side. The fur is rendered with expressive, sketchy lines, and the background is minimal, featuring vertical lines that suggest a wall or paneling. The sketch is monochromatic, using black ink on beige paper, with visible paper edges and a signature in the lower right corner.
