The image is a monochromatic pencil sketch of a tree, characterized by its twisted and gnarled trunk and sprawling branches. The artist uses varied line weights to depict the texture of the bark and the delicate foliage. The sketch is executed in a loose, expressive style, with the tree occupying the central portion of the page. The absence of color and background elements directs focus to the tree's form and texture.
