The image is a monochromatic pencil sketch of a nude figure lying on their back with their head tilted upwards. The figure's body is relaxed, with one arm extended and the other bent at the elbow. The artist has skillfully used shading to depict the contours and musculature of the body, creating a sense of volume and form. The hair is loosely drawn, adding to the serene and tranquil atmosphere. The signature "J.J.SSE.HARST" is visible in the lower right corner.
