She wears a headpiece and a necklace, and is holding a slender object, possibly a candle holder, with her right hand. Her left hand rests on a vertical surface, suggesting interaction with an unseen object. In the background, a bearded man with a crown-like headpiece appears to be observing her. The sketch includes architectural elements and a small, detailed object resembling a perfume bottle.
