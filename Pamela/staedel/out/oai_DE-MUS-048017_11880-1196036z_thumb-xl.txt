The image displays two pencil sketches on a beige paper page, each with a simple yet evocative style. The top sketch, labeled "1," depicts a rural landscape with a triangular-roofed structure and a few other buildings, set against a gently rolling horizon. The bottom sketch, labeled "4," shows a group of trees and a structure, possibly a bridge, with a soft, diffused appearance. Both sketches are dated "April 1846," suggesting they are historical studies.
