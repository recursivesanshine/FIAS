The image is a sepia-toned sketch depicting an intimate moment between an adult and a child. The adult, likely a woman, is seated with her head bowed, embracing the child closely. Her hair is tousled, and she is wrapped in a garment with visible folds, suggesting a sense of weariness or care. The child, partially visible, seems to be resting against the adult, contributing to the tender atmosphere. The background is minimal, with vertical lines that may indicate a wall or tree trunks, enhancing the focus on the figures.
