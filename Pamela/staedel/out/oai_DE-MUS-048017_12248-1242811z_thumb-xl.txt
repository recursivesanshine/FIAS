The image displays two monochromatic sketches on a textured paper background. The sketches are likely pencil drawings, featuring a central, darker area that suggests a cave or natural depression. The upper sketch is smaller and more abstract, while the lower one is larger and more detailed, with lighter areas indicating a surrounding landscape. The text "Domonkos, Hungary, 1912" suggests the sketches were made in Hungary in 1912.
