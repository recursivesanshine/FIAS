The image is a detailed pen-and-ink drawing featuring five figures in a semi-circular arrangement, likely from the Northern Renaissance period. The figures are dressed in period-appropriate clothing, with women wearing headdresses and men in robes. The central figure is seated, with one hand on the ground and the other on her head, suggesting distress or sorrow. To her left, a woman leans in with a hand to her forehead, indicating concern or contemplation. A man with curly hair stands behind the seated figure, looking down with a somber expression. To the right, a woman kneels in prayer, her hands clasped in a gesture of supplication. The clothing is intricately detailed, with flowing robes and headdresses, adding to the somber and reflective atmosphere.
