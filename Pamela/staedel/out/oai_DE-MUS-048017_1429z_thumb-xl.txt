The painting depicts a serene rural landscape with a winding path leading through a lush forest. In the foreground, cows graze peacefully, and a traveler on horseback is accompanied by a donkey laden with goods. The path is bordered by a variety of trees, some with autumnal hues, and a rocky cliff on the right. In the distance, a river flows through a valley with distant hills under a partly cloudy sky.
