The image is a monochromatic sketch depicting a barren landscape. At the forefront, a large, twisted tree trunk lies on the ground, with its roots exposed, suggesting a natural or possibly man-made fall. Several leafless trees with thin, reaching branches are visible in the background, contributing to a sense of desolation. The ground is lightly sketched with small rocks and sparse vegetation, and a faint reflection or puddle is present at the base of the trunk. The sketch is executed in pencil on textured paper, with a signature and date, "H.J. Draper, 1886," in the lower right corner.
