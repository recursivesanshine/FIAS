The image features two artistic sketches of letters 'S' and 'U' integrated with mythical creatures. The 'S' is formed by a mermaid-like figure with a flowing tail, gracefully arching her body. The 'U' is shaped by a creature resembling a satyr or faun, sitting and holding a staff, with a whimsical and playful demeanor. The sketches are monochromatic, using sepia tones on a plain background, with the artist's signature "G.W. Meyer" visible.
