The image is a detailed pencil sketch depicting a dynamic and chaotic battle scene. Central to the composition is a mounted figure, likely a leader, who stands out amidst the surrounding chaos. The scene is filled with figures in various states of action, some engaged in combat, others falling or being trampled. The sketch is executed with expressive lines, capturing the intensity and movement of the battle. In the background, an archway and onlookers suggest the scene is taking place in a public space, possibly a city square. The artist's signature, "R.H.D.," is visible in the lower right corner.
