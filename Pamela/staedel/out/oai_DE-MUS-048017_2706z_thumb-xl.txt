The image is a monochromatic architectural sketch featuring a prominent column with detailed moldings, including a capital and base, set within an interior space. The column is centrally positioned, with a staircase leading to an unseen upper level on the left. The sketch uses linear perspective to create depth, with the floor and ceiling lines converging towards a vanishing point. The drawing is executed in pencil, with shading that suggests a light source from the upper left, casting soft shadows on the floor.
