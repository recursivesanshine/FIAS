The image is a monochromatic sketch on aged paper, featuring a detailed drawing of a classical urinal. The urinal is depicted with a human-like face on the back, set within an arched design, and supported by a rectangular base with a flared bottom. The sketch is executed in fine lines, with cross-hatching to suggest texture and depth. The paper shows signs of aging, with a slightly yellowed tone and rough edges. The signature "Vilbel. 8. Juli 1856." is inscribed at the bottom right, indicating the artist and date.
