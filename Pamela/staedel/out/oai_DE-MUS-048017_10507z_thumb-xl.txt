The image is a detailed black and white sketch capturing a serene forest scene. The central focus is a prominent tree with a twisted trunk and sparse branches, suggesting a late summer or early autumn setting. Surrounding it are dense clusters of trees, some with full foliage, while others are bare, indicating a transition between seasons. The sketch uses varied line weights to create depth and texture, with lighter areas suggesting sunlight filtering through the leaves. A simple fence is visible on the right, hinting at a rural or semi-rural environment. The date "3 Sept. 1864" is inscribed at the bottom, adding historical context.
