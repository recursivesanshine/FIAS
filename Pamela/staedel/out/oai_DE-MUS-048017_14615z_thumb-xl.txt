The image features two pencil sketches of individuals seated on the ground, each dressed in loose-fitting garments. The upper sketch shows a person sitting with legs crossed, wearing a long-sleeved top and a draped garment, with a gentle, contemplative expression. The lower sketch depicts another individual in a similar pose, with a more relaxed posture and a slightly forward-leaning head. The sketches are executed with fine lines, highlighting the folds of the clothing and the subtle contours of the figures. The paper shows signs of age, with some discoloration and spots.
