The sketch depicts a group of six figures, likely a family, gathered around a cart in a rural setting. A central woman, possibly a mother figure, stands with her hair flowing, suggesting movement or wind. She is surrounded by children and other women, some seated and others standing, with one child being held. The attire is simple, indicating a humble lifestyle. The cart, with its large wheel, is partially loaded with hay or straw. The background is minimal, with hints of a landscape and a distant horizon.
