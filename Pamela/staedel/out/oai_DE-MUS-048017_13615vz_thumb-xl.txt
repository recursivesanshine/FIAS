The image depicts a scene with three figures and a seated elderly man. The seated man, dressed in a blue robe and pink undergarments, is the central figure, with his leg extended and foot being attended to by a figure in a green cloak. To the left, a figure in a white robe and crown holds a sword, while a smaller, grotesque figure with a spiked head stands between them. The scene is set on a simple chair with a sketched hourglass beside it. The text "Sandalet is worsthful" is inscribed above.
