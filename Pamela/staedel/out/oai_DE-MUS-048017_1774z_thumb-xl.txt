The painting depicts a serene rural landscape under a clear blue sky with scattered clouds. In the foreground, a dirt path winds through lush greenery, with several figures engaged in agricultural activities. A man with a dog walks along the path, while others are seen tending to the fields. The middle ground features rolling hills with patches of cultivated land, and in the distance, a town with a prominent church tower is visible. The scene conveys a sense of tranquility and harmony with nature.
