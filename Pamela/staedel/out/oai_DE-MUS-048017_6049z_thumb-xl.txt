The image is a watercolor sketch featuring three individuals seated on a box, likely from a historical period. The central figure is a young woman with a contemplative expression, her hand near her mouth, wearing a white blouse, a dark skirt, and a red and blue striped sash over her shoulders. She has a white cap with a ribbon. The two figures behind her are similarly dressed, with one facing away and the other slightly turned. The attire and style suggest a rural or folk setting.
