The image is a pencil sketch on aged paper, featuring three figures in profile view. The central figure stands upright, wearing a long dress and a bonnet, holding a small object in her hand. To the right, another figure is seated, engaged with a container, possibly a pail or basin. The third figure, partially visible, is also in a bonnet and dress, suggesting a historical or traditional setting. The sketch is simple, with minimal detail, and the paper shows signs of age and wear.
