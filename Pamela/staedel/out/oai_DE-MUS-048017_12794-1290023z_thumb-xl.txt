The image displays two pencil sketches on a beige paper, each depicting plant life with delicate lines. The top sketch shows a cluster of thin, leafless branches, while the bottom sketch features a single tree with a complex, twisting trunk and branches. The sketches are signed with "J.P. Millet 1849," indicating the artist and date. The paper's aged appearance and the sketches' monochromatic tones contribute to a serene and contemplative atmosphere.
