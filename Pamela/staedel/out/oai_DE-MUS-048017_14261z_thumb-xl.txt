The image is a sepia-toned sketch depicting a poignant scene with four figures. On the left, a woman stands with an expressive gesture, possibly in a state of distress or appeal. In the center, a reclining figure, likely a woman, is attended to by another figure seated beside her, who appears to be offering comfort or care. The fourth figure, seated on the right, observes the scene with a somber demeanor. The sketch is loose and expressive, with flowing garments and minimal background details, focusing on the emotional interaction among the figures.
